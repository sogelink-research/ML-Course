A few comments about the structure:

- The `presentations` directory contains the slides used in the course with all the source files. Look at the [`README.md`](presentations/README.md) file inside the directory for more information.
- The `notebooks` directory contains Jupyter notebooks with the same organization as the `presentations` directory. The notebooks are intended to provide an environment and tips to explore some of the techniques mentioned in the presentations. Look at the [`README.md`](notebooks/README.md) file inside the directory for more information.
- The `misc` directory contains various information related to the course and its evolution.
