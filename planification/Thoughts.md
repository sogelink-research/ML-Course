# ML Introduction Course Ideas

## Courses

### INF554

Interesting course [here](httpsstanford.edu~shervineteachingcs-230cheatsheet-recurrent-neural-networks)

### INF573

Lecture 5:

- Lots of interesting things in the lecture, starting from no prior knowledge
- List of ML techniques
- K-nearest neighbor
- Na√Øve Bayes
- Logistic regression
- SVM
- Randomized Forests
- Boosted Decision Trees
- RBMs
- Neural networks
- Bayesian network
- Convolutional Neural Networks

### INF581

Reinforcement Learning so not really the subject

### MAP583

- Lecture 5 about Recurrent Neural Networks

## Ideas/Questions

- Introduction course with the basics, vocabulary and general ideas of ML (data preparation, introduction to techniques...)
- Focus rather on classical ML techniques which are rather plug and play or on neural networks for which I have more to say
- Time-series analysis is something I have never really done
- Focus rather on some theoretical background or on practical matters about using the techniques
- Interest in Reinforcement Learning?

### Feedback

- Time-series forecasting
- NLP
- Theorize on what you really want to get from the model
